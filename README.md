# JHG-SC
A project to extend the Junior High Game with a social choice aspect.

The Junior High Game was built in the research lab of Dr. Jacob Crandall to study social dynamics. To see the current version, see beta.juniorhighgame.com. This project, also developed in Dr. Crandall's lab, extends the Junior High Game by adding a social choice voting system.
The primary goals are to study how the social dynamics in the Junior High Game affect a different system, where interests may or may not be aligned in the same way as in the Junior High Game running in parallel. 

The implimentation of the Junior High Game that this is built on was developed for a paper accepted at the 2024 IJCAI conference. That code can be found here github.com/jakecrandall/IJCAI2024_SM
The development of this project was started as a fork of the above repository and can be found here https://github.com/seanvsmith1901/IJCAI2024_SM
